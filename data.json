DBP appealed invoking its boards fiscal autonomy and a subsequent presidential approval, but the Commission on Audit affirmed the disallowance and held the officers liable while excusing passive recipients.

Whether DBP Circular No. 10 computing the money value of leave credits based on gross monthly cash compensation is valid.\n\n2.

Under the Omnibus Rules on Leave and established jurisprudence, the formula for the money value of leave credits is based on monthly salary which refers strictly to basic pay excluding allowances and bonuses.

The COMELEC First Division cancelled his certificate of candidacy ruling that he failed to prove the capacity to launch a nationwide campaign while the COMELEC En Banc denied his motion for reconsideration for being allegedly defective and filed out of time despite proof of compliance. Petitioner filed a certiorari petition and secured a Temporary Restraining Order from the Supreme Court to stop the enforcement of the resolutions but the COMELEC proceeded to print the ballots without his name rendering his inclusion impossible.","issue": "1. Whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring the petitioner a nuisance candidate.\n\n2. Whether the members of the COMELEC are liable for contempt for violating the Temporary Restraining Order.","ruling": "1. YES, the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion. Under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code nuisance candidates are those who file candidacies to mock the election process cause confusion or lack bona fide intention to run which does not include the lack of a nationwide support network. Here the COMELEC erroneously disqualified the petitioner based on his limited popularity in Northern Mindanao and lack of political machinery which are not qualifications prescribed by the Constitution or the law. Hence the disqualification was invalid although the petition for inclusion in the ballot was denied for being moot due to the completion of pre-election activities.\n\n2. YES, the members of the COMELEC are liable for contempt. Under jurisprudence and the Rules of Court disobedience to a lawful writ or injunctive order constitutes indirect contempt which warrants a penalty or reprimand. Here the COMELEC members proceeded with the printing of ballots excluding the petitioner despite the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the enforcement of the disqualification ruling. Hence the members are guilty of contempt and are severely reprimanded for disregarding the Courts directive.","dispositive": "WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Wilson Caritero Amad is DENIED insofar as it has become MOOT and ACADEMIC. Nevertheless, the members of the Commission on Elections are found GUILTY of CONTEMPT of the Supreme Court for their disobedience to the Court's lawful directive, specifically the Temporary Restraining Order dated January 20, 2022. Accordingly, they are REPRIMANDED for this disobedience. SO ORDERED."}},
"129": {"digest": {"grNo": "251587-88","doctrine": "An affidavit constitutes hearsay evidence without probative value when the affiant is not presented on the witness stand to testify and be subjected to cross-examination by the adverse party. Consequently a conviction anchored primarily on such hearsay evidence and ambiguous admissions in counter-affidavits that are qualified by specific denials fails to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence and warrants the acquittal of the accused for lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt.","facts": "Accused Pimentel and Reyes as municipal mayor and barangay captain respectively were charged with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No 3019 and Malversation for allegedly diverting government construction materials intended for a solar dryer to Pimentels private resort. The prosecution relied mainly on the affidavit-complaint of a former barangay captain who did not testify and the accuseds counter-affidavits which admitted the existence of the complaint as public record but denied the commission of the crime explaining that the materials were moved for safekeeping due to flooding. The Sandiganbayan convicted both accused based on the alleged admissions in their counter-affidavits and the hearsay complaint prompting this appeal where the accused argued the insufficiency of evidence.","issue": "Whether the Sandiganbayan erred in convicting the accused based on the affidavit-complaint and their counter-affidavits.","ruling": "YES, the Sandiganbayan erred. Under the Rules on Evidence and established jurisprudence an affidavit is merely hearsay evidence when its maker does not take the witness stand and admissions must be clear and categorical to support a conviction. Here the prosecution failed to present the complainant as a witness making her affidavit hearsay while the alleged admissions in the counter-affidavits were qualified by specific denials and insufficient to prove that the materials were misappropriated for personal use. Hence the Supreme Court reversed the conviction and acquitted both accused as the prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","dispositive": "WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 4, 2019, and the Resolution dated January 24, 2020, issued by the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0479 and SB-16-CRM-0480, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellants Rogelio Maquinano Pimentel and Herminigildo Quico Reyes are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. SO ORDERED."}},
"130": {"digest": {"grNo": "252214","doctrine": "In cases of incestuous rape committed by a father against his daughter the element of force or intimidation is substituted by the moral ascendancy and influence exercised by the offender over the victim requiring only proof of carnal knowledge to sustain a conviction. Consequently the failure of the victim to testify regarding the actual use of force or threat does not preclude a conviction for rape where DNA evidence conclusively establishes that the accused fathered the victims child.","facts": "Accused-appellant BBB was charged with two counts of rape against his minor daughter AAA but the victim failed to testify during trial due to financial constraints and misinformation regarding DNA costs. The prosecution relied on DNA evidence showing a 99.9999 percent probability that BBB was the father of AAAs child alongside stipulations regarding the testimony of the victims aunt and the victims birth certificate proving her minority. The Regional Trial Court convicted BBB of one count of rape based on the DNA result and circumstantial evidence while acquitting him of the other count. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction with modification as to the damages awarded ruling that the DNA evidence conclusively proved carnal knowledge and that moral ascendancy substituted for force.","issue": "Whether the accused-appellant is guilty of rape despite the victims failure to testify to prove the element of force or intimidation.","ruling": "YES, the accused-appellant is guilty. Under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code and established jurisprudence on incestuous rape the moral ascendancy of a father over his daughter substitutes for the element of force or intimidation. Here the DNA evidence conclusively proved that the accused had carnal knowledge of his daughter and his status as her biological father provided the overpowering moral influence that rendered proof of actual force unnecessary. Hence the prosecution successfully established all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt despite the absence of the victims testimony.","dispositive": "WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Decision dated November 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 11429 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant BBB is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.
